# CPP-Exercises

Each cpp file with a main function in the parent dir compiles into a app executable. If some exercises needs nultiple files, create a folder and add them in. Child folders with CMakeLists.txt inside are automatically added for compilation and files in a folder are complied into one single executable.

To Compile,

  $ cmake
  $ make
