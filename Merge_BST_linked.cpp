Given 2 binary search trees, merge them into a Doubly linked list in sorted order.

Convert the given binary trees into 2 doubly linked lists. Idea is to traverse the list in reverse inorder (right->root->left) and insert each element encountered in the front of the list. This will be sorted list in desending order.
